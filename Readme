This project is to create recommendation system for MOOC data.
The recommendation system is implemented using both apriori algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm.

Apriori Algorithm for MOOC course recommender.

This is a python file that recommends the course based on Apriori algorithm.

The data that this requires is a csv file that should have two columns one with userid and other columns should include course IDs.

The code make use of the following libraries

pandas
numpy
networkx
mlxtend.frequent_patterns import
apriori
association_rules
plotly.express
plotly.graph_objects
mlxtend.preprocessing
TransactionEncoder
glob

Also, the code is built on google colaboratory.

The program outputs a file "Freq2020.csv" that contains the courses frequently done together.

k-Means Algorithm

This file contains information about how to run k-means clustering for semester data on an NPTEL course. The code was run and tested on the Google Colab environment.

1. Load the zipped folder containing the MOOC course data on Google Drive.
2. Specify the directory for the unzip (!unzip) command and the glob() functions in the code.
3. Run the file.

-You can alternately load the file from local device and run. In that case, the file importing commands will need to be changed accordingly.

-The code was run for two offerings' data and with 10,000 learners' data only. You can change the code accordingly to accommodate more data.
